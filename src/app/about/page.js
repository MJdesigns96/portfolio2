                        <h1>Marcus Jeong</h1>
                        <p>Hi there, my name is Marcus. I'm a web developer based out of Toronto Ontario, Canada.</p>
                        <p>Currently studying Web Developement at College and open to taking Internship and Work opportunities.</p>
                        <p>I've tried various different paths before settling on Web Development and I believe the reason I settled on this career path were beacause of 2 qualities about myself:</p>
                        <p>My curiosity to learn about things and my drive to constantly improve.</p>
                        <p>I've found that in this field you need to constantly keep learning, adapting, and growing your skills using the plethora of resources available from very talented people online.</p>
                        <p>Over time I fell in love with improving my skills and being able to apply the things I've learned into products.</p>
                        <p>I believe these qualities also appear in my hobbies which include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li className='list-group-item'>Cooking üç≥</li>
                            <li className='list-group-item'>Exercise üèãÔ∏è</li>
                            <li className='list-group-item'>Most things nerdy üòÅ</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>I find that being able to break down big problems or goals into smaller steps, slowly experiment, apply those things, and learn over time is found across all my hobbies as well as my code.</p>
                        <p>If there are any questions about Coding or any of my hobbies please feel free to reach out.</p>
