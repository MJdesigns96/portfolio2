                        <h1>Marcus Jeong</h1>
                        <p>Hi there, my name is Marcus. I'm a Full Stack web developer based out of Toronto Ontario, Canada.</p>
                        <p>I've tried various different paths before settling on Web Development.</p>
                        <p>In school I had studied Philosophy and Psychology because I was interested in the workings of the Human Mind. How and why we make decisions and how we think about those descisions.</p>
                        <p>From this study I had tried various paths before settling on the tech industry. Originally, I had studied UX/UI Design with a focus on UX research. I was fascinated by how people interacted with online media and how design decisions could greatly influence how users would move through a digital product.</p>
                        <p>While studying UX/UI, I had started to code and had fallen in love with developing websites and applications.</p>
                        <p>I fell in love with Web Development because it allows me to pursue 2 goals that I find across all of my hobbies and my professional goals: </p>
                        <p>Allowing me to constantly imrpove and to let me research about topics to find solutions.</p>
                        <p>I love to get better over time and have fallen in love with the continuous growth that this field allows me to do. I am always learning, testing new things, and becoming a better developer over time.</p>
                        <p>Every time I run into a problem I am able to search online and research on a solution.</p>
                        <p>These two things are important to me because I find comfort in being able to be adaptable and learn. I love improving step by step as well as researching on my own on new ways to imrpove.</p>

                        <p>I believe these qualities also appear in my hobbies some of which include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li className='list-group-item'>Cooking üç≥</li>
                            <li className='list-group-item'>Exercise üèãÔ∏è</li>
                            <li className='list-group-item'>Most things nerdy üòÅ</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If there are any questions about Coding or any of my hobbies please feel free to reach out.</p>
